I wrote this code myself,

I refered the blocks of code from the lectures such as dir(), pipe(), fork2.c, wait(), dup2(), stat(). I followed the structure in the program 4's notes. 
Most of my codes are based on the things I learned from the lecture notes. 

The problem I have that I couldn't implement a multiple pipe with the loop. I stuck on hooking pipes inside the loop.
I tried many ways to make it works but it seems I got something wrong with the file descriptor in the loop.

I wrote the pipe subroutine that handles the specific number of pipe for the input files.
